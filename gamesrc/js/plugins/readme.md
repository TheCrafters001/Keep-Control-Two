### Why is there no plugins here, but there are plugins listed in [the plugin file](../plugins.js)?
Most plugins (if not, all of them) have specific terms & conditions, or licenses.
While I could manually select out the plugins to keep in here, I feel like that would be a waste of time.

So, I have hidden this folder, so I don't get into any trouble. Don't owrry, official game builds will still have all the plugins in place!
